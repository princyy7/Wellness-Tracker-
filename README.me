# Wellness Tracker HTML Project

This is a simple HTML project sent by my colleague. It contains a single webpage that opens directly in a browser.  

## How to Use
1. Download the HTML file.
2. Open the file in any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) to view the webpage.

## Notes
- If there are additional files like CSS, JS, or images, make sure they are in the same folder as the HTML file for everything to display correctly.
- This project is meant for learning and demonstration purposes.
